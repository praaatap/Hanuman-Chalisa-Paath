## 🙏 Purpose

In a world filled with digital noise, this app serves as a quiet corner for your spiritual journey. Every design choice—from the saffron hues to the gentle breathing cycles—is intended to help you center yourself before engaging with the sacred stotrams.

## ✨ Devotional Experience

- **Meditative Breathing**: A simple guide to Pranayama before you begin your path, helping to calm the mind.
- **Deep Meanings**: Verse-by-verse translations and audio to help you connect more deeply with the essence of Tulsidas's composition.
- **Consistent Sadhana**: A small counter to help you track your daily practice.
