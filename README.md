## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The app is built on three core pillars:

2.  **Premium Experience**: Using high-quality typography (Newsreader & Manrope) and subtle micro-animations to create a world-class spiritual experience.
3.  **Connection**: Bridging the gap between ancient wisdom and modern technology for the younger generation.
